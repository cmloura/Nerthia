_The Legend is loosely translated from Proto-Vadimarian tablets found near Hutton_

In the lands of Volograd, where the sky kisses the mountains and the Drethe river sings through ancient forests, there were three tribes: the Huim, Hutton, and M'Dib. Each tribe was noble and proud, known for their strength and the ancient bloodlines that connected them to the very heart of Volograd. But even in this land of beauty, shadows stirred, for the dragon lord, Azgrathok, had been born in the southern lands, his malevolent gaze set upon consuming the world in flames.

As the skies darkened with the spread of Azgrathok’s wings, the 13 goddesses, protectors of Nerthia, called forth champions to stand against the tide of darkness. Among those summoned were three heroes: Sir Ellar of the Huim, Sir Laller of the Hutton, and Lady Ellel of the M'Dib. Each bore the hopes and dreams of their people, and each carried a piece of the sacred light bestowed upon them by the goddesses.

Sir Ellar, with his impenetrable armor, was the strongest of the Huim, a people known for their unbreakable spirit. His heart was as steadfast as the mountains his tribe called home, and his courage was a beacon for those who followed him. Sir Laller, the swiftest knight of the Hutton, was as sharp as the {shield}? he wielded. His people lived by the shield and were unmatched in their mastery of warfare. Lady Ellel, the wisest of the M'Dib, carried the knowledge of ages within her. Her tribe was revered for their deep connection to the natural world, and she could command the very elements to aid her in battle.

Together, these three warriors ventured into the heart of the Sinful Lands, where Azgrathok’s lair lay. The journey was fraught with peril—fiery chasms, treacherous winds, and the dragon lord’s minions that lurked in every shadow. Yet, Ellar, Laller, and Ellel pressed on, their determination unwavering, for they knew the fate of Nerthia rested upon their backs.

At the summit of the Dark Isle, the final battle commenced. Azgrathok, a colossal beast of scales and heads, rose from the depths of his lair, his roar shattered the very earth. The heroes fought valiantly, their weapons striking true against the dragon’s hide, their magic and skill holding the darkness at bay. But Azgrathok was a creature of terrible power, and the battle took its toll.

One by one, the heroes fell. Sir Ellar’s armor shattered as he landed the final blow to Azgrathok’s chest, the flames of the dragon consuming him as he stood his ground. Sir Laller, with his last breath, drove his {shield}? deep into Azgrathok’s heart, severing the beast’s lifeline even as the dragon’s tail struck him down. Lady Ellel, with her dying words, unleashed a storm that tore the sky asunder, calling down the fury of the elements to seal Azgrathok’s fate. The dragon lord was vanquished, but the cost was great.

As the life faded from the three heroes, the goddess of healing, Cina, descended from the heavens, her presence a soothing light amidst the devastation. She knelt beside each of the fallen warriors, tears of silver falling from her eyes. Moved by their sacrifice, she made a vow, one that would resonate through the ages.

“For your courage, for your love of this land and its people, I, Cina, promise this: Those who are faithful to me, who carry kindness in their hearts and strength in their souls, shall always be provided for. In times of need, they shall find solace. In times of despair, they shall find hope. Your sacrifice will not be in vain, for your legacy will live on in the hearts of the faithful, forever blessed. My staff shall be the sign of my promise to you fallen heroes three.”

And so it was that the bodies of Sir Ellar, Sir Laller, and Lady Ellel were laid to rest, entombed within the elements: their graves marked by the eternal flame of their courage. The tribes of Huim, Hutton, and M'Dib mourned their loss but honored their memory with every breath. The goddess Cina’s promise held true, for in the years that followed, the faithful of Nerthia always found healing and protection in times of strife.
