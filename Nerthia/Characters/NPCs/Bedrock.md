### Background
Bedrock was a cultist in the Cult of Cthulhu. He demonstrated a new type of magic, a [[Domain Expansion]], to Ausra, Revin and Sir Adamantus that enabled him to make a wish. He successfully fended off the party from interfering with the summoning of [[The Hound]] in [[Zinda]]. This led to the party being marked by the hound. It is unknown if Bedrock survived the summoning.
