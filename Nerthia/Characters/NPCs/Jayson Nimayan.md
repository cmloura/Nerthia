### Background
Jayson was the heir to the Nimayan magic family of Frienan. He along with [[Arual Armm]] fought against the party while at the Togami Family Mansion. After encountering [[Cyrus Drake]] in the Tower of Invisibility, he and Arual were convinced to join [[The Frienan Restorationists]] after learning of the world beyond Frienan. During the party's encounter with Jotaro Togami, Jayson knocked Togami out of the building and landed the killing blow. Jayson escaped to [[The Radiant Citadel]] with the party and was held with the other escapees. During the [[Destruction of the Radiant Citadel]], it is unknown what became of him.

###  Powers
As heir of the Nimayan family, Jayson possessed the Nimayan family power of heat transfer. The Nimayans are able to transfer heat from the Taiyo itself into their own personalized special powers. Jayson would harness the Taiyo's energy to create smaller orbs of fire like a necklace around his neck which he integrated into his martial arts. 

After the last of the four towers which powered the Taiyo was deactivated, Jayson was unable to use his power.
