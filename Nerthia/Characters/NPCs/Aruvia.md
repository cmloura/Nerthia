### Background
Aruvia is supposedly a vampire from Burgdorj, a city in The Forest of the Lost, [[Valencia]]. She supposedly has had many husbands (all of whom she has killed), and she even killed her parents in her ascension ritual as Queen of Vampires. Aruvia joined the tournament to find her next husband and has her eyes set on [[Omar]]. She was eliminated during the first round of the tournament by [[Donovan Vanitosh]], an undead hunter.
