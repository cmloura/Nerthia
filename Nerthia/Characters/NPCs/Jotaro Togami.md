Moniker: _Frienan's Most Powerful Sorcerer_

### Background
Jotaro Togami was a Frienan politician, the head of the Togami Family, and the most powerful sorcerer in Frienan. As head of the Togami family, Jotaro was an influential politician who supported the policies of the President. Jotaro had the power of negation of solid objects, and was able to delete objects the size of a person out of existence. He was the father of two sons and a daughter: [Byakuya](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian%20Vault&file=Byakuya%20Togami), Ryuji and Yuki.

### Ideology and Death
Jotaro actively fought against [[ The Frienan Restorationists]] both physically and legislatively as he completely despised what they stood for. After learning that his son Byakuya had joined the Restorationists, Jotaro vowed that he would die trying to stop the group from achieving their goal of deactivating the Taiyo. While fighting the Frienan Restorationists at the top of The Tower of Negation as the final bastion for protecting the Taiyo, Togami deleted Arual Armm from existence and killed his son, Byakuya, who he deemed to be a traitor to the Togami family name. Jotaro was then killed by Cyrus Drake, Jayson Nimayan, Omar, Larry Biggs and Ylt.

## Physical Description
Jotaro Togami was a monster in terms of speed and strength. He was seemingly able to move almost instantaneously, unable to be hit by opportunity attacks. He was also strong enough to kick Omar into a wall and have the wall break.

##### Special Abilities
Deletion: Jotaro was able to delete a solid object that was medium sized. He used this on Arual Armm and killed her instantaneously. Jotaro could also use his deletion as a form of healing to negate the damage he was dealt.

##### Specialized Equipment
Jotaro Togami fought with multiple weapons that he would summon and make disappear. One of the more deadly weapons that he fought with was a red chained staff divided into 3 pieces that he had sharpened. The weapon not only did massive damage but had reach. Omar is currently in possession of this weapon.
