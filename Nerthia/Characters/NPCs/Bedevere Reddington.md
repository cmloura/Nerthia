### Background
Bedevere is a pirate on Captain Robert's Witterell's ship, The Night Queen. He is a happy-go-lucky guy that loves chatter and gossip. He appears to be infatuated with [[Revin Mithralfoot]]'s disdain for him, and she directly caused him to join the tournament after making him soil his pants. Bedevere made it to the second round of the tournament.
