### Background
Kjöllvir was a Giant general and War Chief that fought against the newly-made Autognome Frøthorian forces during the Frøthor Civil War. Kjöllvir fought against the forces led by [[Sir Adamantus]] and [[Sir Argentus]]. He employed great strategy when facing the Autognomes and was a fierce warrior known for his specialty in Cold Magic. Adamantus and Argentus fought Kjöllvir in the southern theater and managed to drive his forces north towards the Dreskal Mountains, deep into Giant territory. It is unknown what happened to Kjöllvir after this as he was never seen again.
