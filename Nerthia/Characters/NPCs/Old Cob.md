### Background
Old Cob is a widely unknown deity of chaos. It was revealed to [[Ylt]] that Old Cob was the god who sang the Song of Creation to create the universe and not the goddesses that comprise the pantheon of the [[Church of Goodness]]. Currently, Old Cob is apparently trapped at the bottom of [[The Abyss]] and wants Ylt to save him.
