### Background
The King in Yellow is the leader of the [[Cult of Cthulhu]]. It appears that his powers distort reality, making it difficult to distinguish what is real or not. The King in Yellow is not outwardly malicious, but his intentions appear to be anything but. The King in Yellow made his first appearance in [[Godsbreath]] in the blighted forest where the blight appeared to be originating from. His second appearance in [[Zinda]] established that he was in the works of summoning his brother - [[The Hound]] -  which cursed [[Revin Mithralfoot]], [[Sir Adamantus]], and [[Ausra Nothti]], and destroyed Zinda.
