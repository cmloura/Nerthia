### Background
Sholeh was the first and last leader of The Radiant Citadel. An ancient bronze dragon, she was a pioneer who conquered the Ethereal Plane and established a flourishing civilization in [[The Radiant Citadel]]. During her time as leader, Sholeh negotiated and established healthy relations with 15 of the 22 founding civilizations connected to the Citadel.

Sholeh would repeatedly be chosen by the Ancients to continue leading the citadel, and would be driven to overwork trying to maintain peaceful relations with the citadel while tending to her people's needs. Sholeh was well-liked by the people, but was prone to making quick and rash decisions for diplomacy, even if it put the citadel in a bad position.

To ease the stress of being in 16 places at once, Sholeh startedÂ [[The Court of Whispers]], a spy organization devoted to assisting the 15 civilizations that relied on the citadel. Sholeh hand-selected those she found trustworthy and would give them assignments across the multiverse.

#### Destruction of The Radiant Citadel and Death
While seeking to establish diplomatic relations with one of the lost founding civilizations, [[Frienan]], Sholeh foolishly disregarded the warnings from [[Revin Mithralfoot]] about the Destruction of [[Zinda]]. Sholeh, while distracted with the Yeonido and the blight in [[Godsbreath]], also missed a massive plot to destroy the citadel. This came to a point when the plan to wipe out the citadel went into action, and Sholeh began fighting a massive metal colossus in an attempt to save her people. Sholeh successfully destroyed the colossus, but presumably perished within the Keening Gloom shortly afterwards.
