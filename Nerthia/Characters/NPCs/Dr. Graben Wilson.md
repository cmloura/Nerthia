### Background
Dr. Wilson is a gnome Artificer from [[Valencia]]. He attended The Institute of Innovation for a short while until he realized that he did not need a formal education to become a master tinkerer.  He was also infatuated with the occult and the creepy, and dedicated most of his life to creating a machine to commune with the dead. He was hired by the Harpers and was provided funding from them to finish his machine which he named the O.C.D. (The Otherworldly Communication Device). He was sent to [[Halvhrest Manor]] to communicate with [[Mara Silvra]], the previous owner of the house who disappeared from within the walls. After completing his task, he returned to Volograd with the party where he went to patent the O.C.D.
