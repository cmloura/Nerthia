### Background
Obi is the second leader of the Harpers. He is a large orange guy that wields a massive hammer. He hired the party after threatening them that he'd have them taken away by Dakalran soldiers. He requested the party to retrieve a magic item from [[Halvhrest Manor]] for him. He said that he would use the item to overthrow the autocratic Silverdrake royal family. 

Obi was slated to meet with Kalphi and travel to Lund to enact their plan and use the item to end the reign of Gregor Silverdrake.
