### Background
Lolth is likely the current God-Empress of [[Eberron]]. Her rise to power consisted of the deposition of the Psionic Council and the liquidation of the military. While killing the [[Psionic Council]], half of Lolth's face was burned off.

There appears to be a connection between [[Ausra Nothti]] and Lolth...
