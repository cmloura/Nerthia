### Background
Milford Ursis was a Pandursine monk who participated in the 12th Annual Volograd Tournament of Champions. Timid and shy, Milford was paranoid that someone was going to kill him after he was eliminated after the first round of the tournament. This did in fact come true when he was found by the party violently stabbed and burned along with an unknown person.

According to [[Darkon]], a cultist from the [[Cult of Cthulhu]] was planning on killing a tournament contestant. This contestant supposedly found something that the cult wanted, and so the cult sent one of their high-ranking cultists to join the tournament and steal the item and kill the person who found it. It is unknown if it was Milford who the cult was targeting
