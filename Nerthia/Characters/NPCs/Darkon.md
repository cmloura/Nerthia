### Background
Darkon is a green dragonborn from the Sinful Lands. As a kid, he claims to have been a member of a cult called the [[New Age]]. After leaving the continent, he made it his goal to infiltrate cults in order to take them down. He infiltrated the [[Cult of Cthulhu]] where he learned of a conspiracy to kill a member of the tournament and steal an item from them.

He was horrified after learning from the party that they had met and interacted with [[The King in Yellow]], the cult's leader.
