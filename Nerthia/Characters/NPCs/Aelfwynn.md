### Background
Aelfwynn is a human child rescued from the Radiant Citadel after its destruction. She was orphaned in the attack but was adopted by [[Cyrus Drake]]. She is a fast learner and has taken a liking to Cyrus, though he promotes unhealthy lifestyles in her presence. For the duration of the tournament, she has been living with [[Arazar]] and has been kept away from Cyrus due to the [[Rossi Crime Syndicate]] hunting him.

Cyrus has more information about Aefwynn given to him by [[The Dragon Titan]].
