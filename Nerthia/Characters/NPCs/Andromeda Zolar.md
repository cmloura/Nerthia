### Background
Andromeda is a Kalashtar rogue from Eberron. During the uprising of [[Lolth]] as God-Empress of Eberron, Andromeda fled the world when she was 16 years old. She ended up in the Radiant Citadel and worked for Sholeh as a spy for The Court of Whispers. After making enough money, she moved to [[Hutton]] where she currently works as an adventurer for the guild there. 
### Escape from Eberron
When Andromeda was 16, Lolth killed the [[Psionic Council]] and became The God-Empress of Eberron. In the aftermath of her gaining power, Lolth executed all political enemies and liquidated the military. Andromeda left her parents behind and fled the world out of fear of being killed as her father was a soldier for the Psionic Council. She arrived at The Radiant Citadel and met [[Sholeh]] whom she became close with. 
### Work for the Court of Whispers
While saving up money, Andromeda was stationed in [[Zinda]] and Tletepec. Andromeda loved her time in Zinda because of the wine and the natural beauty of the place. After saving enough money, Andromeda moved to Nerthia where she settled in Hutton, Valencia.
