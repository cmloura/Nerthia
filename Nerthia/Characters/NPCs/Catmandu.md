### Background
Catmandu, also known as _The Strongest Tabaxi Sorcerer_ is the only student of Clockwork Sorcery at Djainyn University. He was also the Champion of the 11th Annual Volograd Tournament of Champions. He is disliked for being a cocky and hot-headed individual, but many people hold much respect for his power.

He was severely wounded while fighting an adult black dragon outside the inn in Volograd. As the party left the room where Catmandu was stabilized, he became possessed by something that commanded the party to protect him or else something terrible would happen. [[Omar]] stayed with Catmandu to protect him.
