### Background
Arazar is a Valencian farmer and small-time entrepreneur. Always willing to help, Arazar had previously saved [[Dr. Graben Wilson]] from bandits and let the party stay the night at his house in exchange for help on the farm. He helped train [[Omar]] before the tournament and is currently babysitting [[Cyrus Drake]]'s adopted daughter, [[Aelfwynn]]. 

### Physical Description
Arazar is incredibly fit and lean muscular. His back and parts of his chest are scarred and his left hand and arm are wrapped in bandages. 

It also appears that Arazar has incredible battle prowess and that he may not just have been a farmer his whole life.
