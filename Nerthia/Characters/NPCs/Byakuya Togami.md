### Background
Byakuya Togami was the first son of [[Jotaro Togami]], and future heir of the Togami Family. Byakuya joined [[The Frienan Restorationists]] after apparently failing his 'Examinum' and being 'rescued' by [[Ylt]], [[Cyrus Drake]], [[Omar]], and [[Larry Biggs]]. Incredibly intelligent but rude, Togami formalized the plan to turn off the Taiyo after breaking into his family home and killing his brother, Ryuji Togami, in an accident. Byakuya possessed the power of negation where he could delete small items on a molecular level.

### Waning of the Taiyo and Death
While infiltrating the Infernal Tower with Omar, Byakuya would use the majority of his power in a supporting role until he killed [[Natasha Nimayan]] by deleting half of her head. After finding out that Ylt was killed by Maurice Azkarith, he used the last of his powers to undo her death, but fell into a coma. Ylt, Cyrus, Omar, Larry, [[Jayson Nimayan]], and [[Arual Armm]] would take his unconscious body to the Tower of Negation, and leave his body on the elevator while fighting his father, Jotaro Togami. Byakuya was crushed to death from the falling elevator after his father cut the lines.
