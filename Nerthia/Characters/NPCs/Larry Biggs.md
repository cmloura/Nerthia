### Background
Larry Biggs was the last leader ofÂ [[The Frienan Restorationists]]. Larry led the movement with the help of [[Ylt]], [[Cyrus Drake]] and [[Omar]] to destroy the Four Magical Families in an attempt to escape the country. Larry was the main driving force for The Waning of the Taiyo and the murder of [[Jotaro Togami]], after which he left the organization leaderless.

### Saving the Party
While Ylt, Cyrus and Omar were about to be executed for being not from Frienan, Larry rescued them by blowing up the police station and cutting them loose from their stretchers. He took them to his hideout and recruited them to join his organization, The Frienan Restorationists. 
### Destruction of The Radiant Citadel and Death
After fleeing Frienan, Larry and many of the restorationists would be apprehended by forces from The Radiant Citadel and put on trial. They were found guilty and were to be sent back to the Frienan authorities as a bargaining chip for the Citadel. This failed when The Attack on The Radiant Citadel began. As Larry attempted to flee towards the Nerthia crystal teleporter, he was repeatedly stabbed to death by a cultist.
