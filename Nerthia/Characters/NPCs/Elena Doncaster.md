### Background
Elena Doncaster is the only daughter of King [[William Doncaster]] and heir to the Valencian throne. Rumors say that the princess was born in the light of the full moon and was blessed by Selune, the moon goddess. The Princess Elena is known for her kindness and compassion as well as her extraordinary strength. She has served in the Valencian army since she was 18 and was promoted to Lieutenant General of the Valencian Military. Beyond military expeditions, she has done much for charity and is currently in the process of asking the [[Church of Goodness]] to recognize Selune as one of the Goddesses of Goodness. 

Elena survived to the second round of the tournament. However, after the dragon attack on Volograd, she and the royal entourage were seen leaving the city.
