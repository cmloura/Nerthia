### Background
Arual Armm was the heir to the Armm magic family of Frienan. She previously fought against the party while in the Togami Family Mansion. After encountering [[Cyrus Drake]] in the Tower of Invisibility, Arual and [[Jayson Nimayan]] were persuaded to join [[The Frienan Restorationists]] after learning of the world beyond Frienan. During the party's encounter with Jotaro Togami, she was deleted from existence by him due to her invisibility powers being "annoying."
