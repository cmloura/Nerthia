### Background
Cyrus Drake is a member of a traveling band consisting of himself, [[Omar]] and [[Ylt]]. Cyrus was involved with the Frienan Restorationists and partook in The Waning of the Taiyo and the defeat of the Four Magical families, where he would play a pivotal role in the murder of [[Jotaro Togami]]. He adopted a daughter, [[Aelfwynn]] and joined forces with [[Ausra Nothti]], [[Revin Mithralfoot]] and [[Sir Adamantus]] after arriving in Nerthia and partook on a quest to retrieve an item for [[The Harpers]]. He is a contestant in the Volograd Tournament of Champions but is also being hunted by the [[Rossi Crime Syndicate]]. 

### Life before the Party
Cyrus Drake was born in Zinda and raised with his older brother [[Malistaire Drake]]. 
### Work as a Frienan Restorationist
After being arrested for being not from [[Frienan]], Ylt, Cyrus and Omar were saved by [[Larry Biggs]] and taken to the hideout of the Frienan Restorationists. The bard trio joined the Restorationists and partook in a children rescue mission where they destroyed a "Child Execution Facility." Cyrus would then help break into the Togami Family Mansion and discover that the Taiyo's magic was blocking the teleporter to the Radiant Citadel's magic from being active.

##### The Waning of the Taiyo
The Restorationists planned and launched an attack on the four towers that power the Taiyo. While the other restorationists kept the Keepers of Peace occupied, Cyrus and Larry stormed the Tower of Invisibility, the pinnacle of the Armm Family's invisibility magical prowess. Cyrus encountered [[Arual Armm]] and [[Jayson Nimayan]] and managed to convince them to turn off the Taiyo and leave Frienan. 

Cyrus rendezvoused with Omar and [[Byakuya Togami]] in The Galvanic Tower where they brought Ylt back to life. The party with the help of [[Arual Armm]] and [[Jayson Nimayan]] confronted [[Jotaro Togami]] atop of The Tower of Negation. Jotaro was killed by Jayson, but Arual Armm and Byakuya Togami both died during the fight. 

### Exodus to The Radiant Citadel
After the Taiyo was successfully shut down, the party along with Jayson, Larry and the children that they saved from their first mission as restorationists teleported to The Radiant Citadel where they were met by Sholeh and Citadel forces. 

The party was held in captivity and questioned by Ausra Nothti, Revin Mithralfoot and Sir Adamantus. A trial was held with Sholeh as the judge and the party was found guilty and sentenced to be sent back to Frienan to be used a political fodder for the citadel. 

### The Frienan High Court
After being sent back to Frienan and escorted to the Frienan High Court by the Chancellor, the party was found guilty of both war crimes and crimes against humanity. However during the trial, a thick mist began filling the courtroom, a product of Ausra, Revin and Adamantus's curse. Sholeh was able to teleport them back to the citadel before the creature could be fully summoned.

### Destruction of the Radiant Citadel
After coming back, an explosion rocked the citadel and enemies emerged from three different portals. Cyrus and his party fled to the Nerthia portal, but in the chaos, Larry was tackled by a cultist and repeatedly stabbed to death. Jayson's status and the status of the children that Cyrus helped rescue is unknown. While fleeing, Omar saved a girl from the destruction, and Cyrus unofficially adopted her as his daughter. 

### Arrival in Nerthia
##### The Harper's Request
Cyrus and his party arrived in Nestorshire, [[Dakalra]] where Dakalran troops began murdering refugees from The Radiant Citadel indiscriminately. After taking refuge at The White Faun Tavern and spending the night in a place they were now wanted, they were hired by a Tabaxi named [[Obi]] who requested the party to retrieve for him a magic item located somewhere in [[Halvhrest Manor]]. Retrieving this item would enable to party to travel to [[The Sinful Lands]] in an attempt to rescue Ausra's father on the dime of the Harpers.

##### Adventure in Halvhrest Manor
Cyrus aided in the killing of two of the guards on the bridge on the way to the manor: [[Flaydrin]] and [[Beldroth]].

Halvhrest Manor was incredibly haunted and the semi-final resting place for those who died within the house. Cyrus spent most of his time smoking with Aelfwynn, and was too high to fight the house when it awakened. 

### Travel to Valencia

After delivering the item to the rendezvous point for The Harpers, Cyrus and his party along with [[Dr. Graben Wilson]] crossed the border into Valencia.  They spent the night with a friendly farmer [[Arazar]].

While the party was preparing to leave for Volograd at Arazar's farmhouse, Ylt was brought back to life as her new body descended from the sky and she rejoined the party to Cyrus's amazement.

### The 12th Annual Volograd Tournament of Champions
While in Volograd, Omar registered as a competitor for the Volograd Tournament of Champions and thirsted after [Andromeda](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian%20Vault&file=Andromeda%20Zolar) before becoming Ausra's wingman. Cyrus made it past the first round of the tournament, but later that day, he encountered his brother, Malistaire, who tried to kidnap him along with some thugs from the Rossi Crime Syndicate. Cyrus managed to escape with the help of [[Darkon]].
