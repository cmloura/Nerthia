### Background
Sir Adamantus is an Oath of Glory Paladin from [[Frøthor]]. After his adventures with [[Revin Mithralfoot]] and [[Ausra Nothti]] in Siabsungkoh, he joined [[The Court of Whispers]] where he worked in [[Godsbreath]] where he and the party found out the source of the blight and discovered an underground Kingdom of Undead. He also worked in [[Zinda]] in an attempt to stop the [[Cult of Cthulhu]] from summoning of [[The Hound]], where they failed and were cursed. 

After a failed diplomatic mission to [[Frienan]] to use [[Cyrus Drake]], [[Omar]] and [[Ylt]] as political pawns for the Radiant Citadel, the Radiant Citadel was destroyed and Adamantus and the party fled to Nerthia. After recovering an item for [[The Harpers]] so that they could get a boat to sail to [[The Sinful Lands]] (which didn't work), Adamantus joined the 12th Annual Volograd Tournament of Champions to win a spot on a pirate vessel to the continent.

### Early Life
Sir Adamantus was raised in Frøthor and was built to serve in the [[Frøthor Civil War]]. He served valiantly against the giants with [[Sir Argentus]] and [[Sir Aurus]] and managed to drive [[Kjöllvir]] beyond the Dreskal Mountains. For his feats in battle, he was knighted by King [[Jotun Ironforge]] and was stationed as an official protector of Osk.
 
### Adventure in Siabsungkoh
After meeting Ausra and Revin, the party helped solve a local mystery involving the rivalry of family businesses in The Night Market. After a child was brutally murdered seemingly by the [[Cult of Cthulhu]], [[Snorri Ivarsson]] escorted the party to The Radiant Citadel where they joined The Court of Whispers. 

### Work for The Court of Whispers

##### Godsbreath and The Blight
Adamantus and his companions traveled to [[Godsbreath]] where they discovered that the blight problem plaguing the land was due to the world reverting to its natural state because the gods that blessed the land were gone. They also solved a murder mystery in the blighted forest involving a dragonborn named [[Kirin]], who was sent in the forest days before to investigate the blight. This was also the first encounter with [[The King in Yellow]], who revealed that he is the leader of the Cult of Cthulhu.

They also won the friendship of a colony of sentient undead living far beneath the earth after helping to storm the castle of the undead ruler, Grigor. The coup was successful and a faction of undead who wanted peace with the living people in Godsbreath took over. 

##### Zinda and The Hound
Adamantus and his team were then assigned to go to Zinda to stop a cult problem. There, they became trapped within an infinite hotel - the domain of an unspeakable creature. In there, they discovered that the cult was attempting to summon an eldritch being related to The King in Yellow. They also received cryptic images with their likenesses painted with a warning message to stop the party.

The party was discouraged by The King in Yellow to stop the summoning ritual because he knew that they would fail. The party was confronted by a cultist named [[Bedrock]] who was almost killed immediately by Revin, but used a power never before seen - a [[Domain Expansion]]. He successfully held them off and the party fled as The Hound was successfully summoned. A mark appeared on each of them - cursed by The Hound.

### Opening of the Frienan Portal
The party returned to The Radiant Citadel and were immediately assigned interrogations of Omar, Cyrus and Ylt and to help with establishing diplomatic relations with the newly opened world of Frienan. While in the Frienan High Court, The Hound started being summoned in the courtroom. Revin successfully convinced [[Sholeh]] to leave, and Sholeh teleported them all back to the citadel. 

### The Destruction of The Radiant Citadel
After coming back, an explosion rocked the citadel and enemies emerged from three different portals. The party fled to the Nerthia portal.
### Return to Nerthia

##### Halvhrest Manor
Sir Adamantus got roped into helping The Harpers in exchange for the party's passage to The Sinful Lands. The Harpers needed a magic item in Halvhrest Manor retrieved for them. While exploring one of the upper levels of the manor, his companion, Ylt, was killed by a plague-spreader zombie. Sir Adamantus helped to try to get the magical chicken back from the undead Ylt, and fought during the final battle against the house. 

##### Traveling to Valencia
After meeting at the rendezvous spot, the party was greeted with the news that The Harpers did not have enough money to supply them with a boat. However, Obi told of a captain of a ship who is in Volograd for the annual tournament who may take them there. 

After crossing the Dakalran border with [[Dr. Graben Wilson]], they stayed the night with [[Arazar]] and before setting to Volograd, Ylt was revived as a Plasmoid and the party settled in Volograd

Ausra and Revin parlayed with [[Captain Robert Witterell]], and he gave them an ultimatum: beat his first mate [[M'Bago]] and he will discount the travel fee. If any of their party members wins the whole tournament, he will take them there for free. 

While looking for tournament contestants to help them, Sir Adamantus was able to reunite with Sir Argentus who told him that most people believed Adamantus either dead or a deserter. Sir Adamantus survived the first round of the tournament, and now is in possession of some ceramic frog legs.
