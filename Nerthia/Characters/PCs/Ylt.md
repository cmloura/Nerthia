### Background
Ylt is a member of a traveling band consisting of herself, [[Omar]] and [[Cyrus Drake]]. Ylt was involved with the Frienan Restorationists and partook in The Waning of the Taiyo and the defeat of the Four Magical families, where she would play a pivotal role in the murder of [Jotaro Togami](https://www.worldanvil.com/w/nerthia-selijak/a/jotaro-togami-person). She joined forces with [[Ausra Nothti]], [[Revin Mithralfoot]] and [[Sir Adamantus]] after arriving in Nerthia and partook on a quest to retrieve an item for [[The Harpers]]. Ylt died in Halvhrest Manor while trying to retrieve the item. She was brought back to life by Old Cob and became a Warlock under his patronage. Ylt was brought to Volograd and entered the 12th Annual Volograd Tournament of Champions. 

### Work as a Frienan Restorationist
After being arrested for being not from [[Frienan]], Ylt, Cyrus and Omar were saved by [[Larry Biggs]] and taken to the hideout of the Frienan Restorationists. The bard trio joined the Restorationists and partook in a children rescue mission where they destroyed a "Child Execution Facility," and in the process found a magical chicken. Ylt would then help break into the Togami Family Mansion and discover that the Taiyo's magic was blocking the teleporter to the Radiant Citadel's magic from being active.

##### The Waning of the Taiyo
The Restorationists planned and launched an attack on the four towers that power the Taiyo. While the other restorationists kept the Keepers of Peace occupied, Ylt and the chicken stormed the Galvanic Tower, the pinnacle of the Azkarith Family's lightning magical prowess. Ylt engaged in combat with [[Henri Azkarith]] and mortally wounded him with the chicken. However, after a major blunder and falling multiple floors, she engaged in combat with Henri's father, [[Maurice Azkarith]], where Ylt died the first time.

Ylt was brought back to life by Byakuya Togami and the party with the help of [[Arual Armm]] and [[Jayson Nimayan]] confronted [[Jotaro Togami]] atop of The Tower of Negation. Jotaro was killed by Jayson, but Arual Armm and Byakuya Togami both died during the fight. 

### Exodus to The Radiant Citadel
After the Taiyo was successfully shut down, the party along with Jayson, Larry and the children that they saved from their first mission as restorationists teleported to The Radiant Citadel where they were met by Sholeh and Citadel forces. 

The party was held in captivity and questioned by [[Ausra Nothti]], [[Revin Mithralfoot]] and [[Sir Adamantus]]. A trial was held with Sholeh as the judge and the party was found guilty and sentenced to be sent back to Frienan to be used a political fodder for the citadel. 

### The Frienan High Court
After being sent back to Frienan and escorted to the Frienan High Court by the Chancellor, the party was found guilty of both war crimes and crimes against humanity. However during the trial, a thick mist began filling the courtroom, a product of Ausra, Revin and Adamantus's curse. Sholeh was able to teleport them back to the citadel before the creature could be fully summoned.

### Destruction of the Radiant Citadel
After coming back, an explosion rocked the citadel and enemies emerged from three different portals. Ylt and her party fled to the Nerthia portal, but in the chaos, Larry was tackled by a cultist and repeatedly stabbed to death. Jayson's status and the status of the children that Ylt helped rescue is unknown. 

### Arrival in Nerthia
##### The Harper's Request
Ylt and her party arrived in Nestorshire, [[Dakalra]] where Dakalran troops began murdering refugees from The Radiant Citadel indiscriminately. After taking refuge at The White Faun Tavern and spending the night in a place they were now wanted, they were hired by a Tabaxi named [[Obi]] who requested the party to retrieve for him a magic item located somewhere in [[Halvhrest Manor]]. Retrieving this item would enable to party to travel to [[The Sinful Lands]] in an attempt to rescue Ausra's father on the dime of the Harpers.

##### Adventure in Halvhrest Manor
Ylt aided in the killing of two of the guards on the bridge on the way to the manor: [[Flaydrin]] and [[Beldroth]].

Halvhrest Manor was incredibly haunted and the semi-final resting place for those who died within the house. While exploring with Ausra, Ylt was attacked by a plague-spreader zombie and was killed. Her soul was trapped inside the manor until the house was defeated by the rest of the party and [[Kalphi Yulia]].

### Pact with Old Cob and Revival
After her soul was broken free of the house's curse, Ylt's journey to the afterlife was interrupted and her soul was dragged downwards to Old Cob's place of imprisonment in [[The Abyss]]. 

Old Cob selected Ylt because of her being attuned to his song of creation. He gave her an ultimatum: He will sing the Song of Creation again and bring Ylt back to life but she must rescue him from his imprisonment because the former person that he entrusted with this duty was too much a fool. Ylt agreed to this and became a Warlock under his patronage. Ylt then saw the entire order of the universe and the mechanism that it is.

While the party was preparing to leave for Volograd at [[Arazar]]'s farmhouse, Ylt was brought back to life as her new body descended from the sky. The Song of Creation wasn't perfect however as her body turned into ooze and Ylt became a Plasmoid. 

### The 12th Annual Volograd Tournament of Champions
While in Volograd, Ylt grew a massive orc arm at the registration for the tournament. She has been learning how to use her new body properly.
