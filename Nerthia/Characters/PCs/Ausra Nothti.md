### Background
Ausra Nothti is a Far Traveler Ranger from [[Chuuhon]]. After her adventures with [[Revin Mithralfoot]] and [[Sir Adamantus]] in Siabsungkoh, she joined [[The Court of Whispers]] where she worked in [[Godsbreath]] where she and the party found out the source of the blight and discovered an underground Kingdom of Undead. They also worked in [[Zinda]] in an attempt to stop the [[Cult of Cthulhu]] from summoning of [[The Hound]], where they failed and were cursed. 

After a failed diplomatic mission to [[Frienan]] to use [[Cyrus Drake]], [[Omar]] and [[Ylt]] as political pawns for the Radiant Citadel, the Radiant Citadel was destroyed and Ausra and the party fled to Nerthia. After receiving a vision from her father, Ausra took upon the goal of saving him from [[The Abyss]] in [[The Sinful Lands]]. After recovering an item for [[The Harpers]] so that she could get a boat to sail there (which didn't work), she parlayed with [[Captain Robert Witterell]] for passage to the continent. If any from her party could defeat his first mate [[M'Bago]] in The Volograd Tournament of Champions, he shall allow them passage.

### Early Life
Ausra was raised in Chuuhon in the Temple of the Mind. She was taught by [[Brother Gil]] the ways of [[Jadism]] and all the school knowledge she needed. When she was 20, Ausra ran away from the temple to explore the universe, much to Brother Gil's sadness.
 
### Adventure in Siabsungkoh
After meeting Sir Adamantus and Revin, the party helped solve a local mystery involving the rivalry of family businesses in The Night Market. After a child was brutally murdered seemingly by the [[Cult of Cthulhu]], [[Snorri Ivarsson]] escorted the party to The Radiant Citadel where they joined The Court of Whispers. 

### Work for The Court of Whispers

##### Godsbreath and The Blight
Ausra and her companions traveled to [[Godsbreath]] where they discovered that the blight problem plaguing the land was due to the world reverting to its natural state because the gods that blessed the land were gone. They also solved a murder mystery in the blighted forest involving a dragonborn named [[Kirin]], who was sent in the forest days before to investigate the blight. This was also the first encounter with [[The King in Yellow]], who revealed that he is the leader of the Cult of Cthulhu.

They also won the friendship of a colony of sentient undead living far beneath the earth after helping to storm the castle of the undead ruler, Grigor. The coup was successful and a faction of undead who wanted peace with the living people in Godsbreath took over. 

##### Zinda and The Hound
Ausra and her team were then assigned to go to Zinda to stop a cult problem. There, they became trapped within an infinite hotel, the domain of an unspeakable creature. In there, they discovered that the cult was attempting to summon an eldritch being related to The King in Yellow.

The party was discouraged by The King in Yellow to stop the summoning ritual because he knew that they would fail. The party was confronted by a cultist named [[Bedrock]] who was almost killed immediately by Revin, but used a power never before seen - a [[Domain Expansion]]. He successfully held them off and the party fled as The Hound was successfully summoned. A mark appeared on each of them - cursed by The Hound.

### Opening of the Frienan Portal
The party returned to The Radiant Citadel and were immediately assigned interrogations of Omar, Cyrus and Ylt and to help with establishing diplomatic relations with the newly opened world of Frienan. While in the Frienan High Court, The Hound started being summoned in the courtroom. Revin successfully convinced [[Sholeh]] to leave, and Sholeh teleported them all back to the citadel. 

### The Destruction of The Radiant Citadel
After coming back, an explosion rocked the citadel and enemies emerged from three different portals. Ausra and her party fled to the Nerthia portal.
### Return to Nerthia
##### The Harper's Request
In a strange vision while she was sleeping, her father appeared to her pleading to save him from [[The Abyss]]. Determined to save her father, Ausra accepted the task to retrieve a powerful magical item from Halvhrest Manor for the Harpers who want to use it to overthrow the Dakalran government. In return she wants a boat to set sail for [[The Sinful Lands]].

##### Halvhrest Manor
While in Halvhrest manor, Ausra found an invitation to the masquerade of Lady [[Aeldra Gamonselle]] left by an unknown person. While exploring one of the upper levels of the manor, her companion, Ylt, was killed by a plague-spreader zombie. Ausra helped to try to get the magical chicken back from the undead Ylt, and during the final battle against the house. 

##### Traveling to Valencia
After meeting at the rendezvous spot, Ausra was greeted with the news that The Harpers did not have enough money to supply them with a boat. However, Obi told of a captain of a ship who is in Volograd for the annual tournament who may take them there. 

After crossing the Dakalran border with [[Dr. Graben Wilson]], they stayed the night with [[Arazar]] and before setting to Volograd, Ylt was revived as a Plasmoid and the party settled in Volograd

Ausra and Revin parlayed with [[Captain Robert Witterell]], and he gave them an ultimatum: beat his first mate M'Bago and he will discount the travel fee. If any of their party members wins the whole tournament, he will take them there for free. 

While looking for tournament contestants to help them, Ausra met [[Andromeda Zolar]] (whom she hit it off with) and Brother Gil, her father figure monk.
