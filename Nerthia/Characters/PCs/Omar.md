### Background
Omar is a member of a traveling band consisting of himself, [[Cyrus Drake]] and [[Ylt]]. Omar was involved with the Frienan Restorationists and partook in The Waning of the Taiyo and the defeat of the Four Magical families, where he would play a minor role in the murder of [Jotaro Togami](https://www.worldanvil.com/w/nerthia-selijak/a/jotaro-togami-person). He joined forces with [[Ausra Nothti]], [[Revin Mithralfoot]] and [[Sir Adamantus]] after arriving in Nerthia and partook on a quest to retrieve an item for [[The Harpers]]. He is a contestant in the Volograd Tournament of Champions.

### Work as a Frienan Restorationist
After being arrested for being not from [[Frienan]], Ylt, Cyrus and Omar were saved by [[Larry Biggs]] and taken to the hideout of the Frienan Restorationists. The bard trio joined the Restorationists and partook in a children rescue mission where they destroyed a "Child Execution Facility." Omar would then help break into the Togami Family Mansion and discover that the Taiyo's magic was blocking the teleporter to the Radiant Citadel's magic from being active.

##### The Waning of the Taiyo
The Restorationists planned and launched an attack on the four towers that power the Taiyo. While the other restorationists kept the Protectors of Order occupied, Omar and [[Byakuya Togami]] stormed the Infernal Tower, the pinnacle of the Nimayan Family's heat magical prowess. Omar encountered [[Natasha Nimayan]] and was temporarily tortured by her before managing to escape. They engaged in combat with her which ended with her dying.

Omar and Byakuya rendezvoused with Cyrus and Larry in The Galvanic Tower where they brought Ylt back to life. The party with the help of [[Arual Armm]] and [[Jayson Nimayan]] confronted [[Jotaro Togami]] atop of The Tower of Negation. Jotaro was killed by Jayson, but Arual Armm and Byakuya Togami both died during the fight. 

### Exodus to The Radiant Citadel
After the Taiyo was successfully shut down, the party along with Jayson, Larry and the children that they saved from their first mission as restorationists teleported to The Radiant Citadel where they were met by Sholeh and Citadel forces. 

The party was held in captivity and questioned by Ausra Nothti, Revin Mithralfoot and Sir Adamantus. A trial was held with Sholeh as the judge and the party was found guilty and sentenced to be sent back to Frienan to be used a political fodder for the citadel. 

### The Frienan High Court
After being sent back to Frienan and escorted to the Frienan High Court by the Chancellor, the party was found guilty of both war crimes and crimes against humanity. However during the trial, a thick mist began filling the courtroom, a product of Ausra, Revin and Adamantus's curse. Sholeh was able to teleport them back to the citadel before the creature could be fully summoned.

### Destruction of the Radiant Citadel
After coming back, an explosion rocked the citadel and enemies emerged from three different portals. Omar and his party fled to the Nerthia portal, but in the chaos, Larry was tackled by a cultist and repeatedly stabbed to death. Jayson's status and the status of the children that Omar helped rescue is unknown. While fleeing, Omar saved [[Aelfwynn]]'s life and took her with him through the Nerthia portal.

### Arrival in Nerthia
##### The Harper's Request
Omar and his party arrived in Nestorshire, [[Dakalra]] where Dakalran troops began murdering refugees from The Radiant Citadel indiscriminately. After taking refuge at The White Faun Tavern and spending the night in a place they were now wanted, they were hired by a Tabaxi named [[Obi]] who requested the party to retrieve for him a magic item located somewhere in [[Halvhrest Manor]]. Retrieving this item would enable to party to travel to [[The Sinful Lands]] in an attempt to rescue Ausra's father on the dime of the Harpers.

##### Adventure in Halvhrest Manor
Omar aided in the killing of two of the guards on the bridge on the way to the manor: [[Flaydrin]] and [[Beldroth]].

Halvhrest Manor was incredibly haunted and the semi-final resting place for those who died within the house. Omar experienced some haunting visions of his parents while in the manor. Omar also fought on the frontline against the awakened house.

### Travel to Valencia

After delivering the item to the rendezvous point for The Harpers, Omar and his party along with [[Dr. Graben Wilson]] crossed the border into Valencia.  They spent the night with a friendly farmer [[Arazar]].

While the party was preparing to leave for Volograd at Arazar's farmhouse, Ylt was brought back to life as her new body descended from the sky and she rejoined the party to Omar's amazement.

### The 12th Annual Volograd Tournament of Champions
While in Volograd, Omar registered as a competitor for the Volograd Tournament of Champions. He challenged Arazar to a minor duel where he lost on the first round. Omar trained with Arazar in preparation for the tournament learning how to use a shield. Omar and Cyrus and Adamantus also became well-liked performers in the bars. Prior to the tournament, a contestant named [[Aruvia]] began hitting on Omar, but ultimately made him feel uncomfortable when it was revealed that she killed her own parents. Omar was eliminated during the first round of the tournament along with Aruvia. 

While the party was investigating the string of murders and the dragon attack, Omar was left to take care of [[Catmandu]], but was visited by some strange guests...

### Personality
Omar drinks heavily in an attempt to soothe his mind over the death of his family. He will also take any opportunity to bring up his dead family.
