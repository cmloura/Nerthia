### Background
The Frøthor Civil War was a Civil War in Frøthor between the Dwarvish Kingdom of Frøthor and the Giant Clans. The war started when the Giants attacked the village of Lemmings which prompted a declaration of war from the Dwarven King Jotun Ironforge of Frøthor against the Giant War Chief Commander Rumyr Fjalvor.

### Automaton Conscription
As part of the war effort, King Jotun ordered the building of war machines. The gnomish inventors created the first Autognomes and Warforged as a part of this effort and they were conscripted to join the Frøthorian Army. Prior to this declaration, early artificers (then referred to as _Technomancers_) at [[The Institute of Innovation]], had begun the research of new magic weaponry as a result of the rising tensions on both sides. This research included early Autognome prototypes, but the creation of autognomes wouldn't be fully realized until the declaration of war and the king's orders.

[[Sir Adamantus]] and [[Sir Argentus]] were two autognome war heroes who fought in the southern theater against Giant General [[Kjöllvir]] and successfully drove him back deep into the Dreskal Mountains, after which he was never seen again.

Sir Aurus and Lady Platina defended the northern theater from Rumyr's attacks and were able to kill Rumyr in battle. For these feats, all four autognomes were knighted by King Jotun and were retired to protect the towns of Frøthor.
### Effects
The Frøthor Civil War is the biggest event in a long line of Dwarf and Giant animosity. Since the war, tensions between the Dwarven Kingdom and the Giant Clans have been at their most high. In recent times, tensions have reached boiling points, but no bloody conflicts have happened since the war.
