Date: 30th of Lathandry, 6745
Location: [[The Radiant Citadel]]
Result: 
* [[The Keening Gloom]] overtook the citadel, destroying everything

In the late afternoon of the 30th of Lathandry, an enormous mech emerged from a portal along with cultists from Zinda and an army wielding firearms from Yeonido. The invading forces killed indiscriminately as residents fled through other portals. [[Larry Biggs]] was killed in the chaos and the statuses of [[Jayson Nimayan]] and the children rescued from Frienan are unknown.

[[Sholeh]] engaged with the giant mech while the cultists began a ritual at the Auroral Diamond. Upon completing the ritual, the cosmic storm that had always plagued The Radiant Citadel, The Keeling Gloom, descended upon the citadel. Sholeh was presumably killed by the storm and the entire citadel was overcome by the storm.
