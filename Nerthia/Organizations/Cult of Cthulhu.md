### Background
Not much is known about the Cult of Cthulhu. They appear to be a secret religious society dedicated to [[Cthulhu]]. Led by The King in Yellow, the cult was active in Zinda and was responsible for the destruction of [[Zinda]] and for helping with the attack on [[The Radiant Citadel]]. The group also appears to be responsible for the murder of the boy in the Dyn Singh Night Market over the book filled with strange symbols in an unknown language.

### 12th Annual Volograd Tournament of Champions
According to [[Darkon]], there was a plan set in motion by the cult to have a high-ranking cultist join the tournament in order to kill one of the other contestants. This person apparently got ahold of an item that the cult wants.
