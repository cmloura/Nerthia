### Background
The Harpers are a clandestine anti-government organization based in [[Dakalra]]. Headed by Obi, their goal is to topple the autocratic Silverdrakes from power in the country and establish a socialist government where the people are put above the royal family. Members of the Harpers are largely wanted, but most people in Dakalra support their revolutionary efforts. 

### Mara Silvra
Mara was the original founder of the Harpers over 60 years ago. She founded the organization as a way to combat the cruelty of the Silverdrake royal family. She did this initially by appealing to the "nobility" of the smaller towns around Weras and also by community outreach. This came to a head when the Dakalran government sent their secret police, the [[Mors Gaard]],  led by Jurgen Midglander after Mara during a Harper meeting regarding a magic item that they had found at [[Halvhrest Manor]] (then known as the Silvra Manor). After being sold out by one of her own, Mara proceeded to massacre both the Mors Gaard and the traitorous Harpers. With almost all of the Harper leaders dead, she despaired and locked herself away in the house until her death. This marked the end of the first generation of Harpers.

### Revival of the Harpers
The Harper movement was revived by Obi in 6740 with much criticism. Obi was seen by the public at large as a coward and people thought that he would only be getting himself executed. But Obi managed to continue the work of Mara through his sheer stubbornness and determination. Currently, there are Harpers in every small town in Dakalra, and even a small few who have infiltrated the high walls of the four cities. Obi received a tip from J regarding the history of Halvhrest Manor, and while he was in Nestorshire, he encountered the party after seeing them murder two of the Kings Men. He later threatened them and recruited them to retrieve the item from Halvhrest Manor. He and Kalphi Yulia are currently en route to Lund to use the item and take over the government.
