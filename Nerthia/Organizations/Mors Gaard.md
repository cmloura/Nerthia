### Background
The Mors Gaard are a secret Dakalran government police organization. During the early days of [[The Harpers]], the Mors Gaard were sent to kill the Harper leaders including [[Mara Silvra]]. Many of the Mors Gaard were killed, including Jurgen Midglander, but the organization has lived on. Harpers like [[Kalphi Yulia]] are paranoid about bringing them up, because people who know about the Mors Gaard tend to end up dead. 
### Known Members

- **Hadrian** - A man who appeared in the dreams of [[Sir Adamantus]] and [[Revin Mithralfoot]]. He was ordered to kill the girl that [[Ausra Nothti]] tried to rescue by making it look like she committed suicide.
