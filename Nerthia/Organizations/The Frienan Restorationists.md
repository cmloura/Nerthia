### Background
The Frienan Restorationists were an alleged freedom-fighting organization active in [[Frienan]] founded to stop the culling of unintelligent children and to expose the government's lies. They played a major role in the Waning of the Taiyo and the defeat of the Four Magical Families.

### Culture
The members of The Restorationists all vehemently believed in the group's noble goals. They perceived the government and the four magical families as morally and legally corrupt, with the thought that resorting to violence would be the only way to fight against them.

### Public Agenda
The agenda of The Frienan Restorationists was threefold:

1. Stop the murder of children who failed the Tempus Examinatorum
2. Open a way to the outside world beyond Frienan
3. Expose that there exists life outside of Frienan

### Assets
The Restorationists had a small fighting force of various polyhedra that they stole from their skirmishes with The Protectors of Order.

### Disbandment
After the Waning of the Taiyo and the death of [[Jotaro Togami]], Larry as well as Ylt, Cyrus and Omar fled to the forest where the crystal teleporter to the Radiant Citadel was active. The remaining fighting forces of the restorationists were quickly crushed when the military was called in and with their leader gone and no one left to fill his place, The Restorationist movement died.
