### Background
Dakalra, officially **The Kingdom of Dakalra** is a country in west Vadimar that also consists of the Isle of Lords. It has a land border with Valencia to the east, and is surrounded by the Ostomian Ocean to the west, the Supervadian Sea to the north and the Starfall Sea to the south. Lund is the capital and second largest city.

### History
The country of Dakalra was originally inhabited by various racial clans. The two most prominent clans: The Dakran and the Alrans, conquered the smaller clans over the course of hundreds of years and formed the first Dakalran Kingdom to oppose the powerful Holy Vologradian Empire. The Dakalrans successfully brought about the fall of the Holy Vologradian Empire and King Praeyak Dakran conquered most of the continent in an era known as the **Age of Collapse**.

After Praeyak's death, his three sons warred over the conquered territory for hundreds of years, continuing the war through their posterity. The Age of Collapse ended with the Treaty of Orencrag that established the separate Kingdom of Valencia separate from the Dakalran Kingdom.

There was much backlash from surrendering what was felt to be Dakalran territory to the new Valencian Kingdom. King Tymar Dakran was deposed and replaced with the beginning of the Silverdrake family line. The Silverdrakes promoted great nationalism and the promulgation of "Dakalrans first." 

In modern times, Dakalra is a pseudo-hermit kingdom but also a popular travel destination. The wealthy inhabit the cities and they widely support the oppressive government due to low taxes and high quality of life. The towns surrounding the city are relatively poor and highly taxed. Their taxes fund the elegant lifestyles of those in the cities and people from Dakalran towns are treated like scum. The towns are heavily guarded by the King's Men out of fear of rebellion, and the Dakalran border is heavily fortified and constantly monitored.
