### Background
Djainyn University, formerly known as the Djainai Institution, is a public magic research university in [[Volograd]].  It was initially a research center devoted to the restoration of magics caused from **Arcane Disintegration.** After the restoration of magic, the university predominantly studied the new magics discovered from the voyages beyond [[The Radiant Citadel]] and is considered the first Valencian magic college. In recent weeks, the university had been shut down due to concerns over a potential attack similar to one at occurred at [[The Institute of Innovation]]. An archaeology professor from Djainyn was found murdered and an anthropology professor has gone missing.
