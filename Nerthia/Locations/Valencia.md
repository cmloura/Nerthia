### Background
Valencia, officially **The United Valencian Kingdom** is a country in central Vadimar. It has a land border with [[Dakalra]] to the west, [[Chuuhon]] to the east, and is surrounded by the Supervadian Sea to the north and the Starfall Sea to the south. Nova Perombra is the capital and second largest city.

### History
###### Great Vologradian Empire
Valencia was originally inhabited by the Huim, Hutton and M'Dib people. The Huim and Hutton were at constant war with the western tribes that would eventually form the Dakalrans. The tribes came together under the first emperor Ilrune to drive away the invaders from the west in a city they called Volograd. This was the formation of the **Great Vologradian Empire.**

The M'Dib people formed their own smaller empire within the the great Vologradian empire. After the death of Ilrune, a M'Dib emperor sat on the throne of the Great Vologradian Empire until the M'Dib Empire was destroyed. 

###### The Holy Vologradian Empire
In the power vacuum after the M'Dib emperor's death, a young priest named Odyte Wrynn gained popularity among the Vologradians. He preached about the goodness of the goddesses and about a peaceful world with no more war. There was a strong religious movement in Volograd to the Church of Goodness, and the Great Vologradian Empire was changed to the Holy Vologradian Empire and the [[Church of Goodness]] was formally established by Wrynn.

Many legends emerged during the time of the Holy Vologradian Empire. The most popular of them is called [[The Legend of the Saviors Three]]. They were 3 of the strongest heroes, each from one of the clans of the Vologradian founders. The 3 heroes fought in a holy war with the goddesses against the dragons, but valiantly perished to the Dragon Lord. This legend is the supposed origin of healing magic after the goddess, Cina, promised to always provide healing for those who are faithful to her.

The Holy Vologradian Empire lasted for almost 1500 years, during which, great peace, unity and prosperity was plentiful. There was a small period of turmoil among magic users called **Arcane Disintegration** where the magic types of thunder, lightning, poison and acid were unusable. To study this, [[Djainyn University]] was founded and after some years, the lost elemental magics were restored. After the Dakalran people formed under Praeyak Dakran, the empire collapsed under the weak and incompetent Emperor Claude Thibadeaut and Volograd was sacked and annexed to the First Dakalran Kingdom.
###### The Age of Collapse
After the death of King Praeyak Dakran, almost the entire continent of Vadimar was Dakalran territory. This area was to be divided among Praeyak's three sons: Valencian, Lysander and Grigor. Lysander's forces and bloodline was completely eradicated after the Battle of the Three Brothers and Volograd was annihilated and sunk into what's known as Lake Volograd. The capital city was moved to Perombra.

King Tymar Praeyak was horribly defeated by Rex Praeyak during the Battle of the Forlorn. The war between Valencian and Grigor's bloodlines would finally end with the Treaty of Orencrag in 3947 which divided Vadimar in half: The Dakalran Kingdom and the Kingdom of Valencia. Rex Praeyak became the first King of Valencia.
###### The Kingdom of Valencia
Shortly after the formation of Valencia, the druids of the Buschwald Forest rose against King Rex. Rex died after divine intervention from the Goddess of the Forest, Mielikki, and his body was hung from the Great Tree. Rex's son, Uther, became king and provided protection for the druids.

After the philosopher [[Jad Emerys]] published his philosophy called [[Jadism]], many Valencians desired their own religious state due to persecution by the Church of Goodness. Discourse began over the separation of the eastern coast of Valencia. After 8 years, The Kingdom of Valencia recognized [[Chuuhon]] as its own independent nation separate from Valencia in 4720. All the land east of the Fujaian mountains were given to Chuuhon for the price of everlasting peace between the two nations. Jad Emerys's granddaughter Annamaria Emerys became the first Empress of Chuuhon and began the Emerys Dynasty.

In 5175, a man named Kai Tsu killed the last of the Emerys line and usurped power in Chuuhon. In 5200, Kai Tsu marched an earthen army into Valencian territory and burned the cities of Alexandria and the capital Perombra in an event called **The Ravaging of Valencia**. The great Paladin hero and tactician, Leonidas Eldar, fought Kai Tsu among the rubble of Alexandria and won, driving Tsu's forces out of Valencia.

As reparations and for violating their Valencian Everlasting Peace Treaty, the southeast of Chuuhon was re-annexed by Valencia. 
###### Early Modern and Modern History
After the establishment of the Dwarven kingdom of Frøthor, and prior to the [[Frøthor Civil War]], the [[The Institute of Innovation]] was founded for the development of new war technology, and the beginning of artificery was established.

In 6704, William Doncaster became the King of Valencia and his daughter, [[Elena Doncaster]] was born in 6719. Legends say that the princess was blessed by Selune, the Moon-Goddess, and Elena has been in the process of getting Selune recognized by the Church of Goodness as the 14th goddess in the pantheon.

This year, the Institute of Innovation was destroyed in an explosion. [[Revin Mithralfoot]] was wanted as the most prime suspect, but was cleared after telling a truth machine that it wasn't her.

The [[12th Annual Volograd Tournament of Champions]] was attacked by a dragon on the second day of the tournament and many contestants fell into comatose state after being eliminated by a fire sorcerer.
