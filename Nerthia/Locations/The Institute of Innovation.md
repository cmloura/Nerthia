### Background
The Institute of Innovation is a private artificer research institute in Nova Perombra, Valencia. Established in 6384, The Institute of Innovation has played a significant role in the development of many areas of modern technology and technomancy. It is heralded as the greatest school for artificers in the entire multiverse.

Founded in response to the rising tensions between the giants in Frøthor and the dwarves of Nim'oran, the dwarves worked with the gnomes of Valencia to establish a research institution for the development of new weaponry. After the development of the autognomes for the [[Frøthor Civil War]], the university was formally established in Nova Perombra as opposed to Nim'oran due to the war. Since the war, the university has continued research into weapon development but has branched into almost every area of artificery. 

In 6745, The Institute was destroyed in an explosion. The police were quick to pin the blame on Revin, as she had missed school that day and it was a lab that she worked that which was the source of the explosion.
