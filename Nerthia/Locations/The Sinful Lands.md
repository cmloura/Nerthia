### Background
The Sinful Lands is the southernmost continent in Nerthia. The Sinful Lands is bordered by The Starfall Sea to the north, the Frigian Ocean to the East and The Ostomian Ocean the west. The Sinful Lands include the Elemental Archipelago and covers about 1/5th of Nerthia's landmass.

It is said that the first inhabitants of the continent were the dragons and draconians thousands of years ago. After the arrival of demons to the continent and the fabled Holy War against the dragons, the dragons lost their prominence and the Demons have waged wars against the dragons for the lands ever since. 

Currently, there has been no contact with those that reside on the continent as dangerous currents make landing almost impossible. To this day, no one has survived a voyage to the continent. The only information that is known about the Sinful Lands are those who have fled from it. 

### Religion in the Sinful Lands
According to [[Darkon]], there is a religion devoted to the Dragon Lord called the [[New Age]]. They apparently did horrible things and even treated Darkon as an object of worship.
